Using ground truth segmentations to generate intermediate image representations. Ground truth segmentations are 3D TIF files which different cells are labeled by different number.

Output  2-channel (one for 'distance to nearest cell exterior', another for 'proximity enhanced cell boundary') 3D TIF files.
